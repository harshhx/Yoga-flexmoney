## Description
We have different directories for backend and frontend. I also tried to containerize it using docker but ran into some error due the postgres image. So I made a youtube video which demonstrates my functionallity. 

The backend is made using django. We use django-rest-framework to make rest API which could be called by the frontend web app made with React.js


## Installation

You need to install backend and frontend seperatly.  


You need to move into the backend working directory and then run the following commands.

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Now to set up the frontend,  
move into the frontend directory and then run the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Make sure you already have pip and npm installed in your system.
